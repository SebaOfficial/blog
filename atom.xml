    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="barcodes-vs-qr-codes-101-comparison"><a href="#barcodes-vs-qr-codes-101-comparison">Barcodes VS QR Codes - 101 Comparison</a></h1>
<p>Both barcodes and QR codes offer great functionalities and have embedded themselves in our everyday life, from business applications to personal use.</p>
<p>In this article we&#39;re going to look advantages and disdvantages of both types.</p>
<h1 id="barcodes"><a href="#barcodes">Barcodes</a></h1>
<p>A barcode is a method of representing data in a visual, machine-readable form.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1-dimentional barcodes</strong>: represent data by varying the widths, spacings and sizes of parallel lines.</li>
<li><strong>2-dimentional barcodes</strong> (<em>or matrix codes</em>): represent data using rectangles, dots, hexagons and other patterns.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main components of a barcode include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quiet zone</strong>: blank margin located at either end of a barcode;</li>
<li><strong>Barcode symbol</strong>: the actual representation of the data;</li>
<li><strong>Start character</strong>: the first character in the sequence above the bars;</li>
<li><strong>Data message</strong>: the following characters;</li>
<li><strong>Check digit</strong>: the penultimate character;</li>
<li><strong>Stop character</strong>: the last character in the sequence.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several types of barcodes, each one with symbol variations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>EAN (JAN)</strong>:<ul>
<li>Displays only numerals (0 to 9);</li>
<li>Commonly used for products;</li>
<li>Compatible with EAN in Europe and UPC in the USA.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Interleaved 2 of 5</strong>:<ul>
<li>Uses numerals (0 to 9);</li>

<h1 id="telegram-updates"><a href="#telegram-updates">Telegram Updates</a></h1>
<p>Before writing the code we have to mention that there are 2 methods to get updates from our Telegram bot.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getupdates" rel="external" >getUpdates</a> : used for long polling , usefull if you don&#39;t have a public ip or an https url.</li>
<li><a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#setwebhook" rel="external" >setWebhook</a> : more efficient way for recinving incoming updates, you need to have a public ip address with an https url.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this article we&#39;ll look into both ways of creating a Telegram Bot.</p>

<div class="code-block titled showLineNumber"><h2 class="code-title">src/environment.php</h2><CodeCopy><pre><code class="language-php">{@html String.raw`<div class="code-line"><div class="code-linenotation"><span class="line-number">1</span><span class="no-line-diff"></span></div><div class="code-content">&lt;?php</div></div><div class="code-line"><div class="code-linenotation"><span class="line-number">2</span><span class="no-line-diff"></span></div><div class="code-content"></div></div><div class="code-line"><div class="code-linenotation"><span class="line-number">3</span><span class="no-line-diff"></span></div><div class="code-content">require_once __DIR__ .

<p>As you can see, getting updates from the webhook is much easier than doing it with <code class="inline-code-block">getUpdates</code>.</p>
<h3 id="bootstrap"><a href="#bootstrap">Bootstrap</a></h3>
<p>The <code class="inline-code-block">bootstrap.php</code> file simply sets the webhook to the specified url.</p>

<h3 id="public-file"><a href="#public-file">Public file</a></h3>
<p>The <code class="inline-code-block">src/public/</code> directory will be the one exposed to your web server and it will contain only one file, <code class="inline-code-block">index.php</code></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Telegram bots are special accounts that serve as an interface for code running on a server, allowing for a variety of functionalities within the Telegram platform. They can be used to automate tasks, provide information, interact with users, and even replace entire websites.</p>
<p>In this article, we&#39;ll explore how to build a PHP Telegram bot using the <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api" rel="external" >Telegram Bot Api</a> and <a href="https://botapi.racca.me" rel="external" >TelegramSDK</a>. We&#39;ll walk through the process of setting up the bot, configuring it, and testing it.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites"><a href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h2>
<p>Before we begin, ensure that you have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>PHP installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from the official <a href="https://www.php.net/download" rel="external" >PHP website</a>.</li>
<li>Composer, a dependency manager for PHP. If you don&#39;t have it, you can download it from the official Composer website.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="setup-your-bot-on-telegram"><a href="#setup-your-bot-on-telegram">Setup your Bot on Telegram</a></h1>
<p>The first step is to create a Bot to which users will chat with.
Go to <a href="https://t.me/BotFather" rel="external" >@botfather</a>, start it and type <code class="inline-code-block">/newbot</code></p>

<h2 id="setup-local-envirorment"><a href="#setup-local-envirorment">Setup Local Envirorment</a></h2>
<p>Before actually writing the bot&#39;s logic we need to install the lirary we&#39;re going to use:</p>
<div class="code-block  "><CodeCopy><pre><code class="language-bash">{@html String.raw`<div class="code-line"><div class="code-linenotation"><span class="no-line-number"></span><span class="no-line-diff"></span></div><div class="code-content"><span class="token function">composer</span> require telegramsdk/botapi</div></div>`}</code></pre></CodeCopy></div>
<p><a href="https://github.com/TelegramSDK/BotAPI" rel="external" >telegramsdk/botapi</a> is a light weight library that lets us access the <a href="https://core.telegram.org" rel="external" >Telegram API</a> easly and freely.</p>
<h2 id="write-the-logic"><a href="#write-the-logic">Write the Logic</a></h2>
<p>It&#39;s time for the fun part!</p>
<p>All you need to do is create a new file named <code class="inline-code-block">bot.php</code> (<em>or whatever you like</em>) and write this code:</p>
<div class="code-block titled showLineNumber"><h2 class="code-title">bot.php</h2><CodeCopy><pre><code class="language-php">{@html String.raw`<div class="code-line"><div class="code-linenotation"><span class="line-number">1</span><span class="line-diff"> </span></div><div class="code-content">&lt;?php</div></div><div class="code-line"><div class="code-linenotation"><span class="line-number">2</span><span class="line-diff"> </span></div><div class="code-content">require_once "vendor/autoload.php";</div></div><div class="code-line"><div class="code-linenotation"><span class="line-number">3</span><span class="line-diff"> </span></div><div class="code-content"></div></div><div class="code-line"><div class="code-linenotation"><span class="line-number">4</span><span class="line-diff"> </span></div><div class="code-content">use TelegramSDK\BotAPI\Telegram\Bot;</div></div><div class="code-line"><div class="code-linenotation"><span class="line-number">5</span><span class="line-diff"> </span></div><div class="code-content"></div></div><div class="code-line"><div class="code-linenotation"><span class="line-number">6</span><span class="line-diff"> </span></div><div class="code-content">&#36;bot = new Bot("YOUR_BOT_TOKEN");</div></div><div class="code-line"><div class="code-linenotation"><span class="line-number">7</span><span class="line-diff"> </span></div><div class="code-content"></div></div><div class="code-line"><div class="code-linenotation"><span class="line-number">8</span><span class="line-diff"> </span></div><div class="code-content">&#36;bot-&gt;sendMessage([</div></div><div class="code-line"><div class="code-linenotation"><span class="line-number">9</span><span class="line-diff"> </span></div><div class="code-content">    "chat_id" =&gt; YOUR_CHAT_ID,</div></div><div class="code-line"><div class="code-linenotation"><span class="line-number">10</span><span class="line-diff"> </span></div><div class="code-content">    "text" =&gt; "My First Telegram bot!"</div></div><div class="code-line"><div class="code-linenotation"><span class="line-number">11</span><span class="line-diff"> </span></div><div class="code-content">]);</div></div>`}</code></pre></CodeCopy></div>

<blockquote>
<p>What am I Doing?</p>

<p>Otherwise you can skip this explanation.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s have a look a the code you&#39;ve just written:</p>
<h4 id="instancing-a-new-bot"><a href="#instancing-a-new-bot">Instancing a new Bot</a></h4>
