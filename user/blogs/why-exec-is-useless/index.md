## Linux Permissions
Linux permissions are a cornerstone of the operating system's security, defining who can access or manipulate files and directories.
Among these, the execute (`x`) permission is essential for running scripts and binaries or navigating directories.
But what happens if execute permissions are not paired with read permissions?

In this article, weâ€™ll uncover why the execute permission alone is not enough, diving into practical examples and implications.

### The Role of Execute and Read Permissions
When you attempt to execute a file in Linux, several steps occur:

1. **File Content Access**:
  - The kernel reads the fileâ€™s content to understand how to execute it.
  - For binaries, it examines the <Explanation explanation="Executable and Linkable Format">ELF</Explanation> header.
  - For scripts, an interpreter like Bash or Python processes the file.

2. **Read Permissionâ€™s Role**:
  - Without read permissions, the kernel or interpreter cannot load the file's content into memory, making execution impossible.

Letâ€™s see this in action.

### Example 1: Script Without Read Permission
A file with execute permission but no read permission cannot be executed because the system cannot load its contents into memory.

```bash
echo "echo 'Hello World'" > script.sh
chmod 111 script.sh # Only execute permission
./script.sh
```

The system outputs:
```txt
exec: Failed to execute process: './script.sh' the file could not be run by the operating system.
```

This failure occurs because the system requires read permissions to access the script's content.

### Example 2: Script Without Execute Permission
On the other hand, a file with read but no execute permission can still be executed indirectly, as the content is accessible.

```bash
echo "echo 'Hello World'" > script.sh
chmod 444 script.sh # Only read permission
./script.sh # This generates an error
cp $(which cp) new_script.sh # Copies also all the permissions of another file (the cp executable) to the new script
cp script.sh new_script.sh # Copies the content of the script to the actual script
./new_script.sh # Should execute the script
```

### Implications for Security
Imagine a sysadmin wants to restrict the execution of a sensitive script but allow its content to be readable. This configuration is not secure, as users can bypass the lack of execute permissions.

For example:
1. Users can run scripts using the interpreter directly (`bash script.sh`).
2. They can copy and modify files they can read.

To enforce true restrictions, the sysadmin must remove read permissions for unauthorized users.

### A Practical Docker Example
Hereâ€™s an illustrative example using Docker. Suppose you have a system script intended for administrators only:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
ARG USERNAME=dummy
RUN useradd -m -s /bin/bash $USERNAME
RUN mkdir -p /usr/bin
RUN chmod 755 /usr/bin
# A hypothetical stress test script
RUN echo '#!/bin/bash\n:(){ :|:& };:' > /usr/bin/stress_test
RUN chmod 744 /usr/bin/stress_test
USER $USERNAME
WORKDIR /home/$USERNAME
CMD ["bash"]
```

Running this Docker container:
```bash
docker run --rm -it $(docker build -q -f Dockerfile . )
```

A malicious user could still run the script despite lacking execute permissions:
```bash
bash /usr/bin/stress_test
# OR
cp /usr/bin/ls new_stress_test
cp /usr/bin/stress_test stress_test
./stress_test
```

### Fun Exercise: Restore `chmod`
For a challenge, try restoring the `chmod` command in a Docker container where it has been stripped of execute permissions:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
RUN chmod -x $(which chmod)
CMD ["bash"]
```

Run it with:
```bash
docker run --rm -it $(docker build -q -f Dockerfile . )
```

### Key Takeaways
- Execute permissions are not sufficient on their own; they require read permissions to function.
- Restricting script execution often requires removing both read and execute permissions.
- Always consider the interplay between permissions when setting up secure systems.

With this understanding, you can better manage Linux permissions and secure your systems effectively.
