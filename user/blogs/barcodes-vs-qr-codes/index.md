# Barcodes VS QR Codes - 101 Comparison
Both barcodes and QR codes offer great functionalities and have embedded themselves in our everyday life, from business applications to personal use.

In this article we're going to look advantages and disdvantages of both types.


# Barcodes
A barcode is a method of representing data in a visual, machine-readable form.

* **1-dimentional barcodes**: represent data by varying the widths, spacings and sizes of parallel lines.
* **2-dimentional barcodes** (*or matrix codes*): represent data using rectangles, dots, hexagons and other patterns.

The main components of a barcode include:
* **Quiet zone**: blank margin located at either end of a barcode;
* **Barcode symbol**: the actual representation of the data;
* **Start character**: the first character in the sequence above the bars;
* **Data message**: the following characters;
* **Check digit**: the penultimate character;
* **Stop character**: the last character in the sequence.

There are several types of barcodes, each one with symbol variations:
* **EAN (JAN)**:
  * Displays only numerals (0 to 9);
  * Commonly used for products;
  * Compatible with EAN in Europe and UPC in the USA.
* **Interleaved 2 of 5**:
  * Uses numerals (0 to 9);
  * Standard distribution code;
  * Common in logistics.
* **Codabar (NW-7)**:
  * Uses numerals (0 to 9), symbols, and start-stop characters (a to d);
  * Easily printed;
  * Mainly used for shipping labels, envelopes, and laboratory samples.
* **CODE 39**:
  * Comprises numerals, symbols, alphabetical letters, and start-stop characters;
  * Commonly used in factory automation.
* **CODE 128**:
  * Uses all 128 ASCII characters;
  * Includes 3 start characters, 1 stop character, 4 non-data function characters, and 4 code setting selection characters;
  * Mostly used for electronic part management.


## Advantages
* **Accuracy**: Barcodes enhance data accuracy by minimizing the potential for human errors during data entry. This is crucial for maintaining precise records and preventing mistakes that can occur in manual data input.

* **Speed**: Scanning barcodes is a quick and efficient process, allowing for the rapid handling of transactions. This speed is particularly beneficial in environments where large volumes of data need to be processed swiftly, such as in retail, logistics, and manufacturing.

* **Cost-effectiveness**: Barcodes are a cost-effective solution for companies of all sizes. They are relatively easy to create, implement, and use. The real-time tracking capabilities provided by barcodes contribute to efficient inventory management, reducing the risks of stock shortages and overstocking. This can lead to cost savings and improved overall inventory control.

* **Improved Customer Service**: Barcodes enable businesses to quickly access and retrieve customer information, facilitating
personalized and efficient service. This capability is especially valuable in retail and other customer-oriented industries, where providing tailored service can enhance the customer experience and satisfaction.


## Disadvantages
* **Restricted data**: Barcodes typically store a limited amount of data, such as a serial number or product code. For more detailed information, additional labels or tags may be required. This limitation can be a drawback when more comprehensive data storage is needed.

* **Damage-prone**: Barcodes can be susceptible to damage. Scratches or other forms of damage may make the barcode unreadable, leading to potential issues in data collection and accuracy.

* **Technology Dependency**: Barcodes depend on specialized hardware, such as barcode scanners or mobile devices equipped with scanning capabilities. The need for specific technology may limit accessibility and compatibility with certain systems, especially in environments where such equipment is not readily available.

* **Security Concerns**: Barcodes, if not properly secured, can be easily copied. This vulnerability may pose a risk of fraud or counterfeiting, especially if the barcodes are used for authentication or verification purposes.

* **Environmental Impact**: The materials used to make barcodes are often non-biodegradable. Improper disposal of barcode-related materials can contribute to environmental issues, such as increased trash and pollution. Considering environmentally friendly alternatives or disposal methods becomes important in addressing this concern.


## Generate Barcodes (Linux)
Install the barcode generator:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install barcode
```

Generate the barcode:
```bash
barcode -E -b "id:0123456789" > barcode.ps
```

Convert it to png:
```bash
convert barcode.ps barcode.png
```

# QR Codes
QR Codes are a type of two-dimensional matrix barcodes, they consists of black squares arranged in a square grid on a white background, including some fiducial markers, which can be read by an imaging device.

QR codes offer remarkable versatility, making them a powerful tool for various applications:
* **Share links**: Generate QR codes with multiple links to effortlessly share URLs, such as web pages, social media profiles, or document links;

* **Send emails**: Simplify communication by sending emails with a quick scan, facilitating seamless connections (*i.e. including reaching out to customer support*);

* **Make phone calls**: Streamline phone calls by using QR codes that redirect to a phone number, eliminating the need to manually dial;

* **Send SMS**: Enhance convenience by utilizing QR codes for preset text messages, sparing users the effort of typing messages manually;

* **Share WhatsApp contacts**: Instantly open WhatsApp chat windows without the hassle of typing and saving contact numbers.

* **Connect to Wifi**: Expedite internet network connections without searching for network names or asking for passwords.


## Advantages
* **Quick & Simple**: QR codes allow consumers to access information swiftly without the need for manual data entry or typing. This quick and simple process enhances user convenience;

* **Large Capacity**: QR codes have a larger data capacity compared to standard barcodes. This makes them versatile and suitable for various applications where more information needs to be stored;

* **Versatility**: QR codes are indeed versatile and find applications in product labeling, promotional materials, event tickets, and more. Their flexibility makes them useful in diverse contexts;

* **Enhancing Consumer Experience**: QR codes can enhance the consumer experience by providing additional information about goods or services. They can also be used to offer discounts and exclusive promotions, adding value for customers;

* **Cost-effective**: QR codes are cost-effective to generate and print. This affordability contributes to their widespread use as a means of providing additional information to customers without significant expense.

* **Contactless**: QR codes can be scanned from a distance, allowing for contactless interactions. This is particularly valuable in public settings, promoting hygiene and safety by reducing the need for physical contact.


## Disadvantages
* **Technology Dependency**: Just like barcodes, QR Codes, depend on specialized hardware, such as barcode scanners or mobile devices equipped with scanning capabilities.

* **Visual Aesthetic Concerns**: Some argue that QR codes can be visually unappealing, and their presence might be considered intrusive in certain designs or settings.

* **User Education**: Some users may not be familiar with QR codes or may be unsure about how to use them.

## Generate QR Codes (Linux)
Install the QR Code generator:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install qrencode
```

Generate the QR Code:
```bash
qrencode -o qrcode.png 'https://example.com'
```
