      "content_text": "BARCODES VS QR CODES - 101 COMPARISON\n\nBoth barcodes and QR codes offer great functionalities and have embedded\nthemselves in our everyday life, from business applications to personal use.\n\nIn this article we're going to look advantages and disdvantages of both types.\n\n\nBARCODES\n\nA barcode is a method of representing data in a visual, machine-readable form.\n\n * 1-dimentional barcodes: represent data by varying the widths, spacings and\n   sizes of parallel lines.\n * 2-dimentional barcodes (or matrix codes): represent data using rectangles,\n   dots, hexagons and other patterns.\n\nThe main components of a barcode include:\n\n * Quiet zone: blank margin located at either end of a barcode;\n * Barcode symbol: the actual representation of the data;\n * Start character: the first character in the sequence above the bars;\n * Data message: the following characters;\n * Check digit: the penultimate character;\n * Stop character: the last character in the sequence.\n\nThere are several types of barcodes, each one with symbol variations:\n\n * EAN (JAN):\n   * Displays only numerals (0 to 9);\n   * Commonly used for products;\n   * Compatible with EAN in Europe and UPC in the USA.\n * Interleaved 2 of 5:\n   * Uses numerals (0 to 9);\n   * Standard distribution code;\n   * Common in logistics.\n * Codabar (NW-7):\n   * Uses numerals (0 to 9), symbols, and start-stop characters (a to d);\n   * Easily printed;\n   * Mainly used for shipping labels, envelopes, and laboratory samples.\n * CODE 39:\n   * Comprises numerals, symbols, alphabetical letters, and start-stop\n     characters;\n   * Commonly used in factory automation.\n * CODE 128:\n   * Uses all 128 ASCII characters;\n   * Includes 3 start characters, 1 stop character, 4 non-data function\n     characters, and 4 code setting selection characters;\n   * Mostly used for electronic part management.\n\n\nADVANTAGES\n\n * Accuracy: Barcodes enhance data accuracy by minimizing the potential for\n   human errors during data entry. This is crucial for maintaining precise\n   records and preventing mistakes that can occur in manual data input.\n\n * Speed: Scanning barcodes is a quick and efficient process, allowing for the\n   rapid handling of transactions. This speed is particularly beneficial in\n   environments where large volumes of data need to be processed swiftly, such\n   as in retail, logistics, and manufacturing.\n\n * Cost-effectiveness: Barcodes are a cost-effective solution for companies of\n   all sizes. They are relatively easy to create, implement, and use. The\n   real-time tracking capabilities provided by barcodes contribute to efficient\n   inventory management, reducing the risks of stock shortages and overstocking.\n   This can lead to cost savings and improved overall inventory control.\n\n * Improved Customer Service: Barcodes enable businesses to quickly access and\n   retrieve customer information, facilitating personalized and efficient\n   service. This capability is especially valuable in retail and other\n   customer-oriented industries, where providing tailored service can enhance\n   the customer experience and satisfaction.\n\n\nDISADVANTAGES\n\n * Restricted data: Barcodes typically store a limited amount of data, such as a\n   serial number or product code. For more detailed information, additional\n   labels or tags may be required. This limitation can be a drawback when more\n   comprehensive data storage is needed.\n\n * Damage-prone: Barcodes can be susceptible to damage. Scratches or other forms\n   of damage may make the barcode unreadable, leading to potential issues in\n   data collection and accuracy.\n\n * Technology Dependency: Barcodes depend on specialized hardware, such as\n   barcode scanners or mobile devices equipped with scanning capabilities. The\n   need for specific technology may limit accessibility and compatibility with\n   certain systems, especially in environments where such equipment is not\n   readily available.\n\n * Security Concerns: Barcodes, if not properly secured, can be easily copied.\n   This vulnerability may pose a risk of fraud or counterfeiting, especially if\n   the barcodes are used for authentication or verification purposes.\n\n * Environmental Impact: The materials used to make barcodes are often\n   non-biodegradable. Improper disposal of barcode-related materials can\n   contribute to environmental issues, such as increased trash and pollution.\n   Considering environmentally friendly alternatives or disposal methods becomes\n   important in addressing this concern.\n\n\nGENERATE BARCODES (LINUX)\n\nInstall the barcode generator:\n\n{@html String.raw`\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install barcode`}\n\nGenerate the barcode:\n\n{@html String.raw`\nbarcode -E -b \"id:0123456789\" > barcode.ps`}\n\n\nQR CODES\n\nQR Codes are a type of two-dimensional matrix barcodes, they consists of black\nsquares arranged in a square grid on a white background, including some fiducial\nmarkers, which can be read by an imaging device.\n\nQR codes offer remarkable versatility, making them a powerful tool for various\napplications:\n\n * Share links: Generate QR codes with multiple links to effortlessly share\n   URLs, such as web pages, social media profiles, or document links;\n\n * Send emails: Simplify communication by sending emails with a quick scan,\n   facilitating seamless connections (i.e. including reaching out to customer\n   support);\n\n * Make phone calls: Streamline phone calls by using QR codes that redirect to a\n   phone number, eliminating the need to manually dial;\n\n * Send SMS: Enhance convenience by utilizing QR codes for preset text messages,\n   sparing users the effort of typing messages manually;\n\n * Share WhatsApp contacts: Instantly open WhatsApp chat windows without the\n   hassle of typing and saving contact numbers.\n\n * Connect to Wifi: Expedite internet network connections without searching for\n   network names or asking for passwords.\n\n\nADVANTAGES\n\n * Quick & Simple: QR codes allow consumers to access information swiftly\n   without the need for manual data entry or typing. This quick and simple\n   process enhances user convenience;\n\n * Large Capacity: QR codes have a larger data capacity compared to standard\n   barcodes. This makes them versatile and suitable for various applications\n   where more information needs to be stored;\n\n * Versatility: QR codes are indeed versatile and find applications in product\n   labeling, promotional materials, event tickets, and more. Their flexibility\n   makes them useful in diverse contexts;\n\n * Enhancing Consumer Experience: QR codes can enhance the consumer experience\n   by providing additional information about goods or services. They can also be\n   used to offer discounts and exclusive promotions, adding value for customers;\n\n * Cost-effective: QR codes are cost-effective to generate and print. This\n   affordability contributes to their widespread use as a means of providing\n   additional information to customers without significant expense.\n\n * Contactless: QR codes can be scanned from a distance, allowing for\n   contactless interactions. This is particularly valuable in public settings,\n   promoting hygiene and safety by reducing the need for physical contact.\n\n\nDISADVANTAGES\n\n * Technology Dependency: Just like barcodes, QR Codes, depend on specialized\n   hardware, such as barcode scanners or mobile devices equipped with scanning\n   capabilities.\n\n * Visual Aesthetic Concerns: Some argue that QR codes can be visually\n   unappealing, and their presence might be considered intrusive in certain\n   designs or settings.\n\n * User Education: Some users may not be familiar with QR codes or may be unsure\n   about how to use them.\n\n\nGENERATE QR CODES (LINUX)\n\nInstall the QR Code generator:\n\n{@html String.raw`\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install qrencode`}\n\nGenerate the QR Code:\n\n{@html String.raw`\nqrencode -o qrcode.png 'https://example.com'`}",

Here's how it works:\n\n * false: set PRODUCTION to false to throw exceptions whenever there is an API\n   error;\n * true: set PRODUCTION to true to suppress exceptions and throw warnings\n   instead.\n\nThe other definitions are useful in our program to output the result of every\nAPI call.\n\n\nBOT.PHP\n\n{@html String.raw`\n1\n<?php\n2\ndefine(\"PRODUCTION\", false);\n3\nrequire_once \"vendor/autoload.php\";\n4\n\n5\ndefine(\"GREEN_TEXT\", \"\\033[0;32m\");\n6\ndefine(\"RED_TEXT\", \"\\033[0;31m\");\n7\ndefine(\"DEFAULT_TEXT\", \"\\033[0m\");`}\n\nINSTANCING A NEW BOT\n\nIn this lines we're importing the library from the vendor/ directory and\ninstancing a new Bot object.\n\n\nBOT.PHP\n\n{@html String.raw`\n1\n<?php\n2\ndefine(\"PRODUCTION\", false);\n3\nrequire_once \"vendor/autoload.php\";\n4\n\n5\ndefine(\"GREEN_TEXT\", \"\\033[0;32m\");\n6\ndefine(\"RED_TEXT\", \"\\033[0;31m\");\n7\ndefine(\"DEFAULT_TEXT\", \"\\033[0m\");\n8\n\n9\nuse TelegramSDK\\BotAPI\\Telegram\\Bot;\n10\n$bot = new Bot(\"YOUR_BOT_TOKEN\", Bot::UPDATES_FROM_GET_UPDATES);`}\n\nPlease remember to replace YOUR_BOT_TOKEN with the actual bot token that\n@botfather [https://t.me/botfather] sent you.\n\nSee \"Setup your Bot on Telegram\n[/create-your-first-bot#setup-your-bot-on-telegram]\" if you don't know how to do\nit.\n\nGETTING THE UPDATES\n\n * while(1) is used to to continuously poll\n   [(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Long_polling)] the Telegram\n   server for new updates.\n * sleep(5) creates an interval from each request to aviod getting timed out.\n * $bot->updates() is one of the few built-in functions of the Bot\n   [https://botapi.racca.me/docs/usage/general] class. See Default Updates\n   [https://botapi.racca.me/docs/usage/updates#default-updates] for the first\n   parameter. The second parameter sets the last update to get only the most\n   recent ones.\n\n\nBOT.PHP\n\n{@html String.raw`\n1\n<?php\n2\ndefine(\"PRODUCTION\", false);\n3\nrequire_once \"vendor/autoload.php\";\n4\n\n5\ndefine(\"GREEN_TEXT\", \"\\033[0;32m\");\n6\ndefine(\"RED_TEXT\", \"\\033[0;31m\");\n7\ndefine(\"DEFAULT_TEXT\", \"\\033[0m\");\n8\n\n9\nuse TelegramSDK\\BotAPI\\Telegram\\Bot;\n10\n$bot = new Bot(\"YOUR_BOT_TOKEN\", Bot::UPDATES_FROM_GET_UPDATES);\n11\n\n12\necho GREEN_TEXT . \"Bot Started!\\n\" .

See the update\n   [https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#update] object.\n * $bot->copyMessage() copies the message and sends it to the user that sent the\n   update ($update->chat->id).\n * if($res->body->ok) checks if the message was sent successfully.\n\n\nBOT.PHP\n\n{@html String.raw`\n1\n<?php\n2\ndefine(\"PRODUCTION\", false);\n3\nrequire_once \"vendor/autoload.php\";\n4\n\n5\ndefine(\"GREEN_TEXT\", \"\\033[0;32m\");\n6\ndefine(\"RED_TEXT\", \"\\033[0;31m\");\n7\ndefine(\"DEFAULT_TEXT\", \"\\033[0m\");\n8\n\n9\nuse TelegramSDK\\BotAPI\\Telegram\\Bot;\n10\n$bot = new Bot(\"YOUR_BOT_TOKEN\", Bot::UPDATES_FROM_GET_UPDATES);\n11\n\n12\necho GREEN_TEXT . \"Bot Started!\\n\" .

      "content_text": "HOW TO BUILD A TELEGRAM BOT USING PHP\n\nTelegram bots are special accounts that serve as an interface for code running\non a server, allowing for a variety of functionalities within the Telegram\nplatform. They can be used to automate tasks, provide information, interact with\nusers, and even replace entire websites.\n\nIn this article, we'll explore how to build a PHP Telegram bot using the\nTelegram Bot Api [https://core.telegram.org/bots/api] and TelegramSDK\n[https://botapi.racca.me]. We'll walk through the process of setting up the bot,\nconfiguring it, and testing it.\n\n\nPREREQUISITES\n\nBefore we begin, ensure that you have the following:\n\n * PHP installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from the official\n   PHP website [https://www.php.net/download].\n * Composer, a dependency manager for PHP. If you don't have it, you can\n   download it from the official Composer website.\n\n\nSETUP YOUR BOT ON TELEGRAM\n\nThe first step is to create a Bot to which users will chat with.
